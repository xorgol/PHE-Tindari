# PHE-Tindari
Code and data for the geometric and acoustic reconstruction of the Greek-Roman theater of Tindari, Sicily.

The currently shared pieces of code are a modification of the SteamVR Teleport script, and OSC position and rotation sender. Both rely on [UnityOSC](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/UnityOSC).
